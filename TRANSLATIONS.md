# Translations

Users have contributed translations in the following languages:
* Chinese
* Dutch
* German
* Greek
* Japanese

We would love help improving the existing translations, or adding a new translation.

## Transifex

We use Transifex, which is free for open-source projects:
* [GPSTest Dashboard](https://www.transifex.com/sean-barbeau/gpstest-android/dashboard/)

[Here](https://docs.transifex.com/getting-started-1/translators) are some instructions for getting started with Transifex.  Please note that if you contribute a translation, you will be expected to keep it up-to-date as the app changes.  The developer will notify you via GitHub or email when new strings in the English files are available for translation, and then you can follow the above process for contributing improvements (but by editing existing translation files instead of creating new files).

## Example translation

You can see a sample translation for Dutch in the following files:

* [`GPSTest/src/main/res/values-nl/strings.xml`](/GPSTest/src/main/res/values-nl/strings.xml)
* [`GPSTest/src/main/res/values-nl/arrays.xml`](/GPSTest/src/main/res/values-nl/arrays.xml)
